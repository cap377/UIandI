    <b>Step #1:</b> Initial screening by recruiter who looks at:
    Experience, grades, employment status, salary requirements, willingness to relocate to Austin (either temporarily for boot camp only or permanently for DevCtr and initial feeling of their ‘soft skills’.  20-30 candidates for 5-10 spots.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Step #2:</b> Technical phone screen by a senior tech resource.
    Evaluated for general skills, problem solving capabilities, and ability to think on their feet (as well as soft skills, again).
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Step #3:</b> Face a panel interview followed by a practical assessment; 90-minute programming/analysis test designed to ensure a candidates resume is reflective of their real-world abilities.  Those who pass both the panel and assessment are offered a position within the company.
